# Compression Algorithms
The goal of this project is to attempt to reproduce various compression algorithms in both C++ and Python.

I will attempt to knock out as many of the following compression algorithms as possible:

## Lossless Data Compression Algorithms
- LZ77
- LZR
- LZSS
- DEFLATE
- LZMA
- LZMA2

## Image and Video Compression Algorithms Based on Deep Learning
- MLP-Based Compression (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- DeepCoder - Deep Neural Network Based Video Compression
- CNN-Based Compression (Convolutional Neural Network)
- General Adversarial Network Based Compression (GAN)
